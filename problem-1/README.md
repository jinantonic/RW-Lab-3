# Problem 1
Convert your notes application from worksheet 1 to use RxJS streams to handle the
mouse events instead of the method you originally used (most likely event handlers)

# My solution
![Sketch](/images/n1.png)
The overall look is identical to my previous note application since the given task only required converting plain JavaScript to RxJS streams to handle the mouse events. A user can add, edit, delete notes and change the background colour. Each memo has a top bar which has a dropdown menu for colour choice, edit / save and delete buttons at the right top corner. The user can select the background colour or use the default beige colour without changing it.
