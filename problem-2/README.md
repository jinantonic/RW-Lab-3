# Problem 2
Implement a count down timer similar using RxJs. The UI would look something like the
following (taken from timer-tab.com – you can ignore the colours etc from image – this
is just to get an idea of UI)

</br>

- User is presented with (A) on page load, enters 2m 30s
- When he inserts a countdown time, the timer starts counting downwards (B)
- Finishes at 00 (C)

</br>

# My solution
![Sketch](/images/timer.png)
This is the overall look of the timer application.
