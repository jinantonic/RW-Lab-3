# Problem 3
Use a parent property in a note class to manage related notes, which is null for top-level notes, and use subscriptions to ensure that deletion of a parent deletes child notes.

This is the overall look of the timer application and extra features are added. As you can see in the image above, the background colour dropdown menu is replaced with a colour input palette. In addition to that, a new button shaped like a child is created which will create children notes which are identical to the parent.
